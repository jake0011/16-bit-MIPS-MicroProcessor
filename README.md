<h1> <center>MIPS IMPLEMENTATION </center></h1>
<br>
A 16-bit CPU implementation based on the mips Instruction Set Architecture
<br>
This is a simple implementation of a MIPS CPU which was done and submitted as a course project to test student's understanding about microproccessor architecture.
<hr/>
This CPU is designed to perform basic arithmetic nad logical operations.
<ul>
  <li>AND 
  <li> OR
  <li> XOR
  <li>NOR
  <li>ADD
  <li>SUB
  <li> Slt (Set less than)
 </ul>

It also is able to perform ```immediate instructions``` in addition to ```jump``` and ```branch``` operations.
